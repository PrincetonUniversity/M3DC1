structMesh.cc creates a "structured mesh" in a rectangle of a specified size with the number of nodes in the x and z direction also specified.  The output is a structured mesh that is stored in an unstructured format which can be used with SCOREC software.  Compile as:

g++ -o structMesh.x structMesh.cc

and run with:

./structMesh.x <number of nodes in the x-direction> <number of nodes in the z-direction> <x-length or rectangular domain> <z-length of rectangular domain>

Note that the domain is 0 <= x <= x-length or rectangular domain , 0 <= z <= z-length of rectangular domain
