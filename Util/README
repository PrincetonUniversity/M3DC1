structMesh.cc creates a "structured mesh" in a rectangle of a specified size with the number of nodes in the x and z direction also specified.  The output is a structured mesh that is stored in an unstructured format which can be used with SCOREC software.  Compile as:

g++ -o structMesh.x structMesh.cc

and run with:

./structMesh.x <number of nodes in the x-direction> <number of nodes in the z-direction> <x-length or rectangular domain> <z-length of rectangular domain>

Note that the domain is 0 <= x <= x-length or rectangular domain , 0 <= z <= z-length of rectangular domain

After running structMesh, the output will be a file called struct.sms.  To be 
able to use this with M3D-C1, this file must be processed by
<SCOREC SOFTWARE PATH>/mctk/Examples/PPPL/PPPL/test/DISCRETE/main struct.sms
which will output a struct-dmg.sms and struct.dmg file which can be used to
run M3D-C1.
