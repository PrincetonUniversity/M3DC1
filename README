1. Set the following environment variables

* M3DC1_ROOT should be set to the directory containing this README
  file

* M3DC1_ARCH should be set to a string describing the build
  environment (for example "OSX")

* M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR should be set to the location where files will be
  installed.  Files will be installed under
  $M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR/include, $M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR/lib, and
  $M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR/bin.


2. Create and edit the file $M3DC1_ROOT/install/make.inc.$M3DC1_ARCH
   to specify the proper compilers and library paths.  An example
   using the gnu compilers can be found in
   $M3DC1_ROOT/install/make.inc.OSX .

   You will need an installation of HDF5.
   You do not need an installation of MPI.


3. Run "make" from $M3DC1_ROOT


4. Run "make install" from $M3DC1_ROOT.  This will install:
   
   Executables in     $M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR/bin/_$M3DC1_ARCH/
   Libraries in       $M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR/lib/_$M3DC1_ARCH/
   Headers in         $M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR/include/
   Fortran modules in $M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR/include/_$M3DC1_ARCH/
