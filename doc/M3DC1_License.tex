\subsection*{M3D-C1 Agreement}
The source code of the M3D-C1 project is available to the world-wide
fusion community. This is normally accomplished by granting
``Read-only'' access to the M3D-C1 Princeton University github
repository. The M3D-C1 code requires the installation of several 3rd party
software packages including MPI, SCOREC and PETSc. The M3D-C1 team may
be available to install these packages at the userâ€™s facility upon
request, but this will require granting user privileges to one or more
M3D-C1 team members and is not guaranteed. The following restrictions
apply:

\subsubsection*{Terms of Agreement}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The M3D-C1 code (binaries and source) will not be passed to
  third parties.
\item Publications or figures made with the M3D-C1 code will
  acknowledge the M3D-C1 code and include references to one or more of
  the original publications (for list of references, see Users Guide
  at m3dc1.pppl.gov)
\item Any paper being submitted to a journal for publication using
  M3D-C1 results must be sent to the M3D-C1 team prior to submission.
\item Modifications made to M3D-C1 by the users of the code will be
  provided to the M3D-C1 team upon request, and will be added to the
  M3D-C1 github repo at the discretion of the M3D-C1 team
\item Any inferred errors or ``bugs'' that the user may find will be
  reported immediately to the M3D-C1 team.
\item It is understood that the M3D-C1 team does not guarantee that
  support will be available to users of the code and that extensive
  support from a M3D-C1 team member(s) generally implies that
  published work will include that team member(s) as coauthor.
\item It is the responsibility of the user to ensure the results of a
  calculation are physically meaningful and converged in numerical
  parameters.
\item Neither the names Princeton, Princeton Plasma Physics
  Laboratory, M3D-C1 nor names of the contributors to M3D-C1 may be
  used to endorse or promote products derived from this software
  without specific prior written permission.
