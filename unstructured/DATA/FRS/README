This is a test case of a m=2, n=1 tearing mode in a cylindrical tokamak with 
equilibrium profiles taken from Furth Rutherford Selberg 1973 (FRS)

GEOMETRY
It is a tokamak of aspect ratio 10 taken as a cylinder in the large aspect 
ratio limit. The cross section is a circle of radius 1 . The plasma extends 
from r=0 to r=1 and there is a perfectly conducting wall at r=1. 

MESH
The mesh is adapted to be finer at the rational surface by doing the following: 
1) A uniform mesh is created : ./main AnalyticModel 0.05 
2) M3DC1 is run with iadapt=2. The parameters of the mesh adaption are in 
sizefieldParam.  The mesh given in the directories is already the adapted one. 
There are two meshes in the two directories 
Mesh11(running time ~ 2 hr on 16p) and Mesh21 (~ 6 hr on 16p)

EQUILIBRIUM
itaylor=16 corresponds to the peaked equilibrium profile from FRS for 
the current, and a parabolic pressure profile p=p0*(1-r**2). 
The parameters are in C1input. They are :
   * p0
   * xlim, which is r0 in the FRS paper, the current width
   * zlim, which is rs in the FRS paper, the position of the rational surface
   * mpol, the m number of the rational surface

IDL
After the run completes, 2 x the growth rate can be viewed by running the 
idl postprocessor:
plot_scalar,'ke',file='..../C1.h5',/growth,yrange=[.004,.005]

ANALYTIC GROWTH RATE
Can be obtained from the AsymptoticMatching code in the subdirectory:
AsymptoticMatching. This needs some work, but the program "inner_compFurth.f"
calculates gamma for one value of eta and is compiled with makeruntest
(after changing name to test_program.f)
