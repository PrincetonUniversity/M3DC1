Resistive Wall Test Problem

Cylindrical equilibrium is initialized in an eigenfunction of a resistive
wall with a m=3, n=3 current pattern surrounded by vacuum.   Analytic
decay rate is printed:   analytic growth rate =  -6.026370307665984E-003
(negative means decay rather than growth).   Use the idl program to 
plot 2 x the computed growth rate (decay) with:
plot_scalar,'ke',file='....../C1.h5',/growth,yrange=[-.02,-.01]

view the eigenfunction with:
plot_field,'psi',10,file='....../C1.h5',/linear,points=200
