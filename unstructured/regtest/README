To run the regression tests on 8 processors, run the following command:

make N=8

If the test is successful, the word "Success!" will be printed at the
end of each test, and the make command will return successfully.

If one of the tests fails, the make command will return with an error
before proceeding to subsequent tests.

To clear the results of the tests, run:

make clean

A brief description of each test follows.

nstx1: Real, 2D NSTX case in a rectangular domain, with numvar=1
nstx2: Same, but with numvar=2
nstx3: Same, but with numvar=3
nstx4: Same, with numvar=3 and ipressplit=1
kink1: Complex, 2D kink mode case in a curved domain
