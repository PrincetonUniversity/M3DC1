The regression tests here work by copying the "base" subdirectory to a
new subdirectory, running the code in the new directory, and comparing
the resulting C1ke file with that in the "base" subdirectory.


IMPORTANT NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
=============================
Binary files, including mesh files, should NOT be included in the git
repository.  Mesh files can be copied to the "base" directories so
that these cases can run when simmetrix licenses are not available,
but shouldn't be added to git.


RUNNING
=======

To submit the regression tests run the following command:

./run <config>

where <config> is an optional keyword describing the particular
configuration you want to use.  New test subdirectories will be named
${M3DC1_VERSION}_<config>, and the batch script batchjob.<config>
(defined in the "base" directories) will be used to launch the jobs.
If <config> is not included, it defaults to $M3DC1_ARCH.


CHECKING RESULTS
================

To check the results of the regression tests, run the following
command:

./check <config>

where <config> has the same value supplied to the "run" script.  The
"check" script will indicate whether the tests have started or
finished.  If they have finished, it will compare the C1ke file with
those in the "base" directory.


CLEANING UP
===========

The test subdirectories can be deleted by running

./clean <config>
