This file should contain a log of all changes to the regression tests,
and the reason for the change.  This could be a change only to the
output (e.g. due to a bugfix); a change to the input (e.g. due to
renaming or obsoleting an input variable); or a change to both
(e.g. due to a substantive change to the mesh or other input files).
