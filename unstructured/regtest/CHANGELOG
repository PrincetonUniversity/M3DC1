This file should contain a log of all changes to the regression tests,
and the reason for the change.  This could be a change only to the
output (e.g. due to a bugfix); a change to the input (e.g. due to
renaming or obsoleting an input variable); or a change to both
(e.g. due to a substantive change to the mesh or other input files).

7/20/2020
Changed: adapt
Reason: C1ke now differs from base version consistently on all systems.
Presumably this difference is due to an algorithmic change in the
SCOREC libraries.  Adaptation still seems to work fine, so we're taking
the new version to be the "correct" one now.

5/22/2019
Changed: KPRAD_2D
Reason: Bug fix for itemp=1 iconst_p=0 iconst_t=1 boundary conditions

5/22/2019
Changed: RMP
Reason: New mesh file to make test case smaller

8/13/2019
Changed: adapt
Reason: New scorec libraries result in different C1ke file.  Mesh
still looks good; not sure if adapted mesh is different or if there is
a difference in how solution transfer is done.

8/16/2019
Changed: KPRAD_2D, pellet
Reason: Moved define_transport_coefficients before solve, so a couple changes.
Particle source now gets initialized for the first time step (corrects bug).
Resistivity now gets updated *after* KPRAD ionize, so Zeff changes.

12/10/2019
Changed: KPRAD_2D, KPRAD_restart, pellet
Reason: Kinetic energy scalars changed to use mass density (rho),
so changes regression tests that have impurities
