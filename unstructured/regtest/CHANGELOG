This file should contain a log of all changes to the regression tests,
and the reason for the change.  This could be a change only to the
output (e.g. due to a bugfix); a change to the input (e.g. due to
renaming or obsoleting an input variable); or a change to both
(e.g. due to a substantive change to the mesh or other input files).


5/22/2019
Changed: KPRAD_2D
Reason: Bug fix for itemp=1 iconst_p=0 iconst_t=1 boundary conditions

5/22/2019
Changed: RMP
Reason: New mesh file to make test case smaller

8/13/2019
Changed: adapt
Reason: New scorec libraries result in different C1ke file.  Mesh
still looks good; not sure if adapted mesh is different or if there is
a difference in how solution transfer is done.

8/16/2019
Changed: KPRAD_2D, pellet
Reason: Moved define_transport_coefficients before solve, so a couple changes.
Particle source now gets initialized for the first time step (corrects bug).
Resistivity now gets updated *after* KPRAD ionize, so Zeff changes.
