! COMPILING M3D-C1
!=================

The 2D real, 2D complex, and 3D real versions of the code can be built
by running

make OPT=1
make OPT=1 COM=1
make OPT=1 3D=1 MAX_PTS=60

respectively from the "unstructured" directory.  System-specific
makefile elements are specified in files named $(M3DC1_ARCH).mk.
Information regarding how to build on some specific systems can be
found in the readme.* files in this directory.

All exceutables associated with M3D-C1 can then be assembled into the
subdirectory _$(M3DC1_ARCH)/bin by running

make bin

These executables will be installed into $(M3DC1_INSTALL_DIR) by
running

make install


!===============
! RUNNING M3D-C1
!===============

Executables are installed on several systems.  Environment modules are
available on these systems in the following locations: 

GA Iris cluster :       /fusion/projects/codes/m3dc1/modules
NERSC Edison :          /project/projectdirs/mp288/C1/modules/edison
NERSC Cori :            /project/projectdirs/mp288/C1/modules/cori
PPPL research cluster : /p/m3dc1/modules
Princeton Perseus :     /home/nferraro/modules

For example, to set the environment variables to run M3DC1 version 1.9
on PPPL, one would execute "module load /p/m3dc1/modules" followed by
"module load m3dc1/1.9".  Loading this module will also load any
additional modules needed, or alert you to module conflicts.
